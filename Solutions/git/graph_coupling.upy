A graph showing the file coupling based on Git history.

<p>Files are nodes, and the edges represent if files were changed in the same
 commit more than "Minimum Coupling"% of the time. The size of nodes is
 related to the number of commits involving the file. The color of the
 nodes/edges indicate what architecture the file belongs to.</p>

<p><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Minimum Coupling %:</b> Filter out edges that represent a coupling less than this percentage</li>
</ul>

<b>Example:</b><br>
