def description():
  return '''Groups files by the Git author(s) who made the most commits to each file.
    <p>Authors can be broken into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Owner: the author(s) with the most commits</li>
      <li>Major Contributor: at least 5% of the commits</li>
      <li>Minor Contributor: less than 5% of the commits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Files with strong ownership are preferred, and files with many minor
    contributors are more bug prone. <span style="color:#8f8f8f"> (Bird,
    Christian, et al. "Don't touch my code! Examining the effects of ownership
    on software quality."Â Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSOFT symposium and the
    13th European conference on Foundations of software engineering. 2011.)

    <p>This architecture groups files by the Owner of each file.</p>
