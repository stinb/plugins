  <p>This plugin identifies functions in your codebase that are likely executed
  on separate threads using Qt's threading mechanisms. It focuses on functions
  passed to QtConcurrent functions and run overloads of QThread and QRunnable.
  By mapping these functions, the plugin helps you visualize and understand the
  potential concurrency in your Qt application.</p>

  <p>See also the check "Data Race" and the architecture "POSIX Thread Entry
  Points"</p>
