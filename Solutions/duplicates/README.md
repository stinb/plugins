This folder contains plugin scripts for duplicate lines of code. All plugin scripts use the common [duplicates.py](https://github.com/stinb/plugins/blob/main/Solutions/duplicates/duplicates.py) so if a script is installed individually, the common file must be installed as well. Instead of installing individual scripts, it's recommended to copy the entire folder to the plugin directory:

- Windows – C:\Program Files\SciTools\conf\plugin\User\
- Mac – /Users/username/Library/Application Support/SciTools/plugin/
- Linux – /home/username/.config/SciTools/plugin/
