def detailed_description():
    return '''\
<p>Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.</p>

<p><b>Rationale</b></p>

<p>This rule appears in most coding guidelines for safety-critical software. The
reason is simple: Memory allocators, such as <b><i>malloc</i></b>, and garbage
collectors often have unpredictable behavior that can significantly impact
performance.</p>

<p>A notable class of coding errors also stems from the mishandling of memory
allocation and free routines: forgetting to free memory or continuing to use
memory after it was freed, attempting to allocate more memory than physically
available, overstepping boundaries on allocated memory, and so on. Forcing all
applications to live within a fixed, preallocated area of memory can eliminate
many of these problems and make it easier to verify memory use.</p>

<p>Note that the only way to dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory
allocation from the heap is to use stack memory. In the absence of recursion, an
upper bound on the use of stack memory can be derived statically, thus making it
possible to prove that an application will always live within its resource
bounds.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<pre><code language="C++">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

static void dynamic()
{
  size_t count = 256;
  int *ptr;

  ptr = malloc(count * sizeof(int));             // Violation
  if (ptr)
    free(ptr);                                   // Violation

  ptr = calloc(count, sizeof(int));              // Violation
  if (ptr) {
    ptr = realloc(ptr, 2 * count * sizeof(int)); // Violation
    if (ptr)
      free(ptr);                                 // Violation
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><b>Developer's Note</b></p>

<p>Only dynamic memory functions/operators in the standard are supported.</p>

<p>The wording of this rule is ambiguous: "do not use dynamic memory allocation
after initialization." We interpret this rule such that dynamic memory
allocation cannot be used at all. This is because the documentation states that
this rule must guarantee that "an upper bound on the use of stack memory can be
derived statically."</p>
