The code intentionally violates a synchronization rule by not locking the second mutex before unlocking the first one.\n\n### Key Operations\nKey operations in this code include:\n-   Using mutexes to protect shared resources.\n-   Locking and unlocking the mutexes to avoid deadlocks.\n-   Violating a synchronization rule by not locking the second mutex before unlocking the first one.\n\n### Overall Functionality\nOverall functionality is that the program successfully demonstrates a critical issue in multithreaded synchronization. If left unchecked, this issue can result in unexpected behavior, including deadlocks.",

It prevents multiple threads from modifying a shared resource simultaneously, thus ensuring data consistency and preventing race conditions.\n\n#### Key Operations ####\nThe mtx_lock function is used to acquire a lock, allowing only one thread to access the locked resource at a time. It is used to synchronize access to shared data structures or other resources that may need to be updated simultaneously.\n\n#### Overall Functionality ####\nThe mtx_lock function implements a locking mechanism that prevents threads from accessing shared resources in an unordered manner. By acquiring a lock, a thread prevents other threads from accessing the same resource until it releases the lock, thereby ensuring that data is accessed consistently and avoiding potential errors due to concurrent access.",
