<p><b>SEI CERT Standards</b></p>

<p>The CERT Secure Coding Standards provide rules for secure coding for
commonly used programming languages. The standards are developed through a
community effort by members of the software development and software security
communities.</p>

<p>The rules and recommendations in these standard are a work in progress and
reflect the current thinking of the secure coding community. As rules and
recommendations mature, they are published in report or book form as official
releases. These releases are issued as dictated by the needs and interests of
the secure software development community.</p>
