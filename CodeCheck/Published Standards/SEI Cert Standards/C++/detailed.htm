<p><b>SEI CERT C++ Standard</b></p>

<p>This standard provides rules for secure coding in the C++ programming
language.</p>

<p>The rules and recommendations in this standard are a work in progress and
reflect the current thinking of the secure coding community. As rules and
recommendations mature, they are published in report or book form as official
releases. These releases are issued as dictated by the needs and interests of
the secure software development community.</p>

<p>The CERT C++ Coding Standard does not currently expose any recommendations;
all C++ recommendations have been removed (moved to The Void section) due to
quality concerns pending further review and development.</p>

<p>The list of rules and recommendations in this tool were last updated on
2023/05/23.</p>
