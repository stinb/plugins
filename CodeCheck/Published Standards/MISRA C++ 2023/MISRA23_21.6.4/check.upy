<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<p>Within a delete-expression, the C++ Standard does not always specify if the sized or the unsized version
of the deallocation function will be selected. Therefore, both versions should be provided, and have
the same effect, to ensure that the behaviour is well-defined.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>The following example is compliant as sized and unsized versions of operator delete are provided:</p>
<pre><code language="C++">void operator delete( void * ptr ) noexcept
{
 std::free( ptr );
}
void operator delete( void * ptr, std::size_t size ) noexcept
{
 delete( ptr );
}</code></pre>
