Redefining an inherited non-virtual function can give the appearance that both

<pre><code language="C++">class B{
public:

<p>Even without knowing anything about B, D, or mf, given an object x of type
D</p>
<pre><code language="C++">D x;        //x is an object of type D</code></pre>
<p>you would probably be quite surprised if this,</p>
<pre><code language="C++">B *pB = &x;        //get pointer to x
pB-&gt;mf();               //call mf through pointer</code></pre>
<p>behaved differentyly from this:</p>
<pre><code language="C++">D *pD = &x;        //get pointer to x
pD-&gt;mf();               //call mf through pointer</code></pre>
<p>That's because in both cases you're invoking the member function mf on the
object x. Because it's the same function and the same object in both cases,
it should behave the same way, right?</p>
<p> Right, it should. But it might not. In particular, it won't if mf is
non-virtual and D has defined its own version of mf.</p>"""
