        "<p>The C90 standard introduced function prototypes, a form of function declarator in which the parameter types were declared. This permitted argument types to be checked against parameter types. It also allowed the number of arguments to be checked except when a function prototype specified that a variable number of arguments was expected. The C90 standard did not <b>require</b> the use of function prototypes for reasons of backward compatibility with existing code. For the same reason, it continued to permit types to be omitted in which case the type would default to <i>int</i>.</p>",
        "<p>The C99 standard removed the default <i>int</i> type from the language but continued to allow K&R-style function types in which there was no means to supply parameter type information in a declaration and it was optional to supply parameter type information in a definition.</p>",
