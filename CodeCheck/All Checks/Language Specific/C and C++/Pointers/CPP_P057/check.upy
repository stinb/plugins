<p><b>A pointer to dynamic memory that is declared and allocated
locally to a function or method should be declared as an
auto_ptr. An auto_ptr</b> and the dynamic memory associated
with it will be deleted when it goes out of scope, unlike a simple
pointer which will go out of scope and cause a memory leak.
This is important when exceptions could be thrown between the
allocation and the deallocation of the memory, causing the
flow to jump out from the current function. A simple pointer
will just go out of scope and cause a memory leak, whereas an
<b>auto_ptr</b> will delete the dynamic memory when it goes out of
scope. The use of <b>auto_ptr</b> does add processing overhead and
should be considered during C++ development.</p>"""
