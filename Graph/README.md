Making Your Own Custom Graphs
Copy the file graph_template.upl.REMOVE to graph_template.upl and modify as desired using the Understand Perl API: https://scitools.com/documents/manuals/perl/

Overview
The ability to draw custom graphs is a core feature of the Understand PERL API. Using the Understand Plugin system, advanced users can develop their own custom graphs addressing specific information needs.
A tutorial for creating your own graphs is here: https://scitools.com/support/api-tutorial-4-graphs/

To install a graph plugin, simply drag the .upl file into the Understand GUI, or you can manually place it in one of the following locations:

Windows – e.g. C:\Program Files\SciTools\conf\plugin\User\Graph
Mac – e.g. /Users/username/Library/Application Support/SciTools/plugin/Graph
Linux – e.g. /home/username/.config/SciTools/plugin/Graph
